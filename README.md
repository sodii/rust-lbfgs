# LBFGS

This repo contains my ongoing efforts to port Naoaki Okazaki&rsquo;s C library
[libLBFGS](http://chokkan.org/software/liblbfgs/) to Rust. Check [rust-liblbfgs](https://github.com/ybyygu/rust-liblbfgs) for a working wrapper around the original
C codes.


# Motivation

-   Bring native LBFGS implementation to Rust community.
-   Learn how a great optimization algorithm is implemented in real world.
-   Learn how to &ldquo;replace the jet engine while still flying&rdquo; [URL](http://jensimmons.com/post/jan-4-2017/replacing-jet-engine-while-still-flying)
