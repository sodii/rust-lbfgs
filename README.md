# LBFGS

This repo contains my ongoing efforts to port Naoaki Okazaki&rsquo;s C library
[libLBFGS](http://chokkan.org/software/liblbfgs/) to Rust. Check [rust-liblbfgs](https://github.com/ybyygu/rust-liblbfgs) for a working wrapper around the original
C codes.


# Motivation

-   Bring LBFGS to Rust community.
-   Learn how a great optimization algorithm is implemented in real world.
